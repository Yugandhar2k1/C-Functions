## Function with No Arguments and with Return Values

The `calculateSum` function does not take any arguments, indicated by `void` in the parameter list.

It calculates the sum of two predefined numbers `num1` and `num2` and stores it in the `sum` variable.

It returns the calculated sum using the `return` statement.

In the `main` function, we call `calculateSum()` with no arguments, and it returns the sum `8`, which we then print to the console.

Functions with no arguments and return values are useful for encapsulating calculations or operations that don't depend on external input. They allow you to compute and return results within the function for use elsewhere in your program.
