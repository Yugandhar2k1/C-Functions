## Function with Argument and No Return Value

The `printSum` function takes two `int` arguments, `num1` and `num2`.

It calculates their sum and stores it in the `sum` variable.

It then prints the sum using `printf`.

The function has a `void` return type, indicating it doesn't return any value.

In the `main` function, we call `printSum` with the arguments `5` and `3`, which results in the sum being printed to the console.

Void functions are useful for performing actions or operations that don't need to produce a return value. They are commonly used for tasks like printing information, modifying global variables, or performing some side effects in a program.
